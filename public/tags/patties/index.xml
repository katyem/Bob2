      <description>The APM represent a new wave of thinking about Krabby Patties. First, I took a hamburger machine and instead of putting meat into it, I put our secret Krabby Patty mixture into it and it worked!! We can now make up to 10,000 patties a day, where before we only made about 50. While we still only sell about 50 a day, we have room to grow now.</description>
